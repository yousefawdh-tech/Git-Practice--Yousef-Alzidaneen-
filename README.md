## 1. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

- **Git** is a version control system used locally to track changes in code.
- **GitHub** is an online platform for hosting and sharing Git repositories, making collaboration easier.

## 2. Explain the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`.

- `git pull`: Downloads changes from a remote repo **and updates your local code**.
- `git fetch`: Only downloads changes — you can **review and merge them manually**.

## 3. What is the purpose of the `.gitignore` file?

The `.gitignore` file tells Git **which files or folders to skip**, such as:
- Logs
- Temporary files
- Python cache files (`__pycache__`, `.pyc`)

## 4. Steps to contribute to an open-source project on GitHub

1. **Fork** the repository to your account.
2. **Clone** your fork to your local machine.
3. Create a **new branch** for your changes.
4. **Make your edits** and commit them.
5. **Push** the branch to your GitHub fork.
6. **Open a pull request** to suggest your changes to the original repo.
